📚 Week 8 – Building in Python: Data Structures & Your First Python Project 🚀
 
 Week 8 of the App Academy — and wow, what a journey it’s been!

⸻

🔙 Looking Back: Week 7

Last week was no walk in the park 😅
I took my first real steps with Python 🐍 and dove straight into backend development and building APIs. It was tough — but I made it through! 🙌

Pushing through that learning curve was a huge win for me. 💪

🔎 This Week’s Focus

This week, I’m continuing my Python journey and going deeper into data structures. I’ll be using what I learn to build a complete backend project — all using Python from the ground up! 🔥

⸻

🧠 What I’ll Learn

I’ll be exploring some of Python’s core data structures:
	•	📦 Lists
	•	📕 Dictionaries
	•	🧱 Tuples
	•	🧮 Sets

Understanding these will help me write cleaner, more efficient code for real-world applications.

🏗️ What I’ll Build

This week is also about putting it all into practice. I’ll be building a real Python project from scratch. That means:
	•	Designing my own backend architecture
	•	Writing all the code myself
	•	Testing and debugging
	•	Creating a functional backend solution using only Python

It’s a big challenge — but I’m ready for it! 💥

⸻

✅ What I Hope to Achieve

By the end of the week, I want to:
	•	Feel confident working with Python’s data structures
	•	Complete my first full backend project
	•	Strengthen my problem-solving and backend logic

🔥 Final Thoughts

This is a huge step forward for me as a developer.
I know it won’t be easy, but I’m excited to take on the challenge, learn as much as I can, and come out stronger on the other side. 💯

Let’s do this! 🚀
